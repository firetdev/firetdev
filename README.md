# Hello there, sir!
## I'm firet, I make programming projects
.....and this is where I put those projects so everyone can see them.

I like making web apps, games, tools, game engines, simulations, APIs, ML algorithms, and pretty much everything else you could imagine.

I'm fluent in:
C++ (including SFML and ImGui)

Python (including NumPy and scikit-learn, which I'm currently learning)

GDScript

JavaScript (including React and Node.js, which I'm currently learning)

HTML/CSS

All 3 major desktop operating systems
