# Hello there, sir!
## I'm firet, I make programming projects
.....and this is where I put those projects so everyone can see them.

I like making web apps, games, tools, game engines, simulations, APIs, ML algorithms, and pretty much everything else you could imagine.

I'm fluent in:  *C++,  Python,  GDScript,  JavaScript,  HTML/CSS*

Using these libraries:  *Godot,  React,  Node.js,  Express,  NumPy,  scikit-learn,  SFML,  ImGui

I've used all 3 major desktop operating systems
